# You - read my read me

## Activity: update your README

Update your `README` with any new things that you missed the first time round. Did you remember about the `package.json`? How about starting the `MySQL` server?

## Activity: test your README

Pair up with someone. Point them at your repository and ask them to use your `README` to get your app running on their machine. Ask them to make a note of any things you could change.
