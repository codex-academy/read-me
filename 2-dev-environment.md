# Set up your dev environment

Make sure your `README` lists all the software they'll need to install on their local system. They'll probably need:

* NodeJS
* npm
* MySQL

Anything else?

## Install the dependencies

How does someone install the dependencies they need for your project? If they run `npm install`, how does NodeJS know what things to install? (You've run `npm install --save-dev <modulename>` a few times now when building your app. What does the `--save-dev` do?)

How about the database? What scripts does someone have to run to set up their local database?
