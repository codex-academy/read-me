# Set up your dev environment

Make sure your `README` lists all the software they'll need to install on their local system. They'll probably need:

* NodeJS
* npm
* MySQL

Anything else?

## Install the dependencies

How does someone install the dependencies they need for your project? If they run `npm install`, how does NodeJS know what things to install? If you've been using `npm install --save-dev MODULENAME` when adding things to your app then you probably have a good idea!

How about the database? What scripts does someone have to run to set up their local database?
