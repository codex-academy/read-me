# Summative Assessment: Systems Documentation

By now you have created a Readme file, and had another coder review and give you feedback on your file.
For this exercise, you will work with a different pair.

You will each test each otherâ€™s Readme by installing the app according to the instructions in the Readme document. 
You may only ask questions and reply via Github Issues. This conversation will be assessed, moderated and submitted to SETA.

## Process
1. Send the Readme.md link to your pair by [raising an issue and tagging their GitHub username](#create-an-issue-to-invite-a-github-user-to-install-your-app)
2. Open their Readme.md file and follow the steps.
3. When you are unsure how to proceed, raise a Github Issue with details (which section you are in, what is unclear). 
 * NB: There should only be one question per Issue
4. When you receive a GitHub issue, you should only reply via the same Github Issue, and should then update the Readme File accordingly to clarify the instruction steps.

### If 3 or less Issues were created:
[Add a link to all the Issues your pair raised](#how-to-link-to-issues-created-by-another-github-user), and add that to the Summative Assessment of your Systems Documentation Portfolio of Evidence.

### If more than 3 questions were needed in order for your pair to install your app
1. Update the ReadMe thoroughly, making sure it is clear enough that anyone can install your app following the ReadMe only.
2. Find another coder to follow the ReadMe; starting from the top :-)

## Create an issue to invite a GitHub user to install your app

## How to link to issues created by another Github user:
1. Make sure you have their correct GitHub username
2. Open your repository, and click on Issues.
3. Update the Filter to select only issues created by that Github user
 * `Is:issue author:CTcodeX`

4. Copy the URL into your PoE form, under Summative Assessment:
 * `https://github.com/avermeulen/quizz-me/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20author%3ACTcodeX`
